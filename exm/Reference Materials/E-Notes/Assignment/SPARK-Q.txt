1. Gathering data:
Identify the data source  and collect the data. Analyze the  raw data and understand the data attributes, quality and limitations
2. Prepare the data and pre-process.
Data preprocessing improves raw data quality
Integrate with various sources of data to enrich the data
Explore the data using graphs and stastics
Clean the data by removing nulls, fill missing data, correct data but maintain orginality
Data transformation using scaling, adding or adjusting features, values
Split data in sets of training and testing data in ration of 70 /30
3. Choose the model 
Analyze the data to choose the best model.
Use  summary , metrics , graphs to choose best fitting model
4. Train the model to improve prediction accurancy and reduce errors
5. Evaluation
Use test data to evaluate the performance of the selected models and compare results
6. Prameter tuning 
Evaluation will help metric your models performance and use results to go back and training the model if the evaluation results have more recall or less accurancy, which can be achived by tuning the paramters
7.Prediction - use real time data to predict the outcome
