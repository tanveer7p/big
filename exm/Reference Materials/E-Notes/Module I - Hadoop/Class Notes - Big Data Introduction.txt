Volume - PetaBytes,Exabytes,Zetta
Velocity - the speed at which the data flows
Variety - different types - 

Veracity - reliability
Value - 

Hadoop
Store - HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System - Blocks - High Availability <-Replication of data
Process - Map Reduce - Job ->Tasks ---> Each task will be executed by different nodes parellel

Vertical Scaling - Scaling up - increasing the power of single machine
Horizontal scaling - Scaling out - 

Batch Processing
not suitable real-time data processing - Spark

HDFS - Master node - Daemon - NameNode - will not store the actual data- Stores Metadata - number of blocks belonging to a file, where these blocks are stored, how many replicas are present and where it is present
       Slave Nodes  - Data Node - Stores the acutal data 
Name node - Daemon - MAster - HDFS
Data Node - Daemon - Slave nodes - HDFS

Map Reduce - Master - Job Tracker
             Slave Nodes - Task Tracker
Mapper - each block /split 
Reducer 





Map Reduce - Job Tracker - Master
             Task Tracker

500MB - 4 blocks of size 128 MB


Hadoop Cluster - commodity hardware - 10-node hadoop cluster
Master-slave architecture
